# StableSort

The goal is to have efficient implementations of sorting algorithms in lean with a non-exclusive focus on stable algorithms.

### Current Targets

The current targeted sorting algorithms are listed below alongwith the most directly used reference for each.
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) : Used as a primitive in other sorting procedures.
* [Naive Quicksort](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Data/Array/QSort/Basic.html#Array.qsort) : Reference Implementation from mathlib. I reimplement this as an exercise for myself.
* [Stable Quicksort]() : Used as a primitive in other sorting procedures. Learnt about this in the context of fluxsort and glidesort (see below)
* [Merge Sort](Any textbooks)
* [Power Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powersort)
* [Quad Sort](https://github.com/scandum/quadsort)
* [Flux Sort](https://github.com/scandum/fluxsort)
* [Block Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_sort)
* [Glide Sort](https://github.com/orlp/glidesort)
